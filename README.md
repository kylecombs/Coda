# Coda

Coda is a browser-based coding environment for creating music with code.  Coda's sound engine is built on the Tone.js API.  In addition we have built a wrapper around Tone.js that is accessed through the Coda object.  Documentation for the Coda object is in development.  In the meantime check out the Tone.js documentation.

I hope that you will enjoy using Coda to explore the creation of music with code. Check out the deployed app at the link below.
